Getting Started
===============

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Cloudlynx cloud! This document is designed to help cloud administrators and system operators get started with the cloud environment. It can also act as a reference for daily operations.

The document covers the following topics:

* Compute instance (how to set up, launch and manage instances)
* Storage options (Block and object storage)
* Introduction to APIs and CLI
* Introduction to orchestration (automate the cloud infrastructure)

Before using the Cloudlynx cloud environment, we recommend reading this document to familiarise yourself with the system.

Additional training courses and course material are available on the Cloudlynx website: https://www.cloudlynx.ch

**Note:** This document assumes you have an active Cloudlynx account.

Cloudlynx Dashboard
-------------------

The Cloudlynx dashboard serves as the starting point when accessing the Cloudlynx graphical user interface (GUI). It provides an overview of the current cloud resources being used, as well as listing the cloud services offered by Cloudlynx.

Log in to the Cloudlynx Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To log in to the Cloudlynx dashboard, use the link provided in the welcome email or use the login link on the Cloudlynx webpage. The login credentials are provided during the registration process.

**Note:** The registration process is not covered in this document. For more information, please visit https://www.cloudlynx.ch/en/registration.

**Note:** In the case of a forgotten password, please go to the account management site https://preview.cloudlynx.ch/account.

Overview of the Cloudlynx Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After successfully logging in to the Cloudlynx dashboard, you will be directed to the **Overview** page.
The **Overview** page provides an overview of the cloud resources: applied limits, currently used cloud resources, as well as providing the possibility to query cloud usage from the past.

The Cloudlynx dashboard is split into 3 sections:

* The side bar (left part of the screen)
* The content pane (middle part of the screen)
* The title bar (top part of the screen)

**Note:** Directions given in this document will use the definitions above.

The Side Bar
""""""""""""
The left section of the Cloudlynx dashboard is called the side bar. Here, you will find a list of the cloud services that Cloudlynx provides as well as your current project.

The side bar has the following menu structure:

**Manage Compute**

* Overview:	provides an overview of the current resource usage
* Instances: create, launch and manage instances
* Volumes: create, attach and manage persistent block storage
* Images & Snapshots: create, upload and manage images and snapshots
* Access & Security: configure security of and access to instances 

**Manage Network**

* Network Topology: provides a graphical overview of the network setup
* Networks: create and configure virtual networks, subnets, gateways, IP allocations
* Routers: create, configure and connect routers to virtual networks

**Object Store**

* Containers: create, upload and manage persistent object storage
	
**Orchestration**

* Stacks: execute automatic deployment of a whole cloud setup (including compute, block storage, object storage, network etc.)


**Note:** The Red Hat tab forwards you to the Red Hat Customer Portal. This feature should not be used, as it will be removed in future updates. A Red Hat account or subscription is required for accessing this section.

The Content Pane
""""""""""""""""

This section displays the main content. The shown content will vary depending on the topic selected from the side bar.
On the **Overview** page you are able to query current and past cloud usage, as well as export the results. This can be done by selecting a **From:** and **To:** date and pressing **Submit**. The results are then displayed.

**Note:** The Date format needs to be YYYY-MM-DD.

A usage summary report can be exported into CSV format. Click on the **Download CSV Summary** button to generate the file.

The Title Bar
"""""""""""""

The title bar can be found at the top of the page and is always displayed independent of any selected topic.

* Logged in as: indicates which user account is currently logged in 
* Settings: change language, time zone, items per page shown and password
* Help: opens the official documentation of OpenStack
* Sign Out: log out of the current session

Change Password
"""""""""""""""
A password change should not be done via the **Settings** link in the title bar. Instead please go to the account management site https://preview.cloudlynx.ch/account. Log in with your credentials, click on the user icon in the upper right hand corner and select **Change Password**.

Key Management
--------------

SSH keypairs are used to access instances securely without specifying a password each time. A keypair can be used for multiple instances that belong to the same project.

**Note:** To access a Linux-based instance for the first time, it must be accessed using an SSH keypair. This applies to the Linux images provided by Cloudlynx only.

Create a New Keypair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three possibilities how to create keypairs. It can be done either directly on the Cloudlynx dashboard by using a third party tool such as the open source tool PuTTYgen on a Windows client, or by using the CLI SSH commands of a Linux client.

On the Dashboard
""""""""""""""""

1. Select the **Access & Security** tab under the Manage Compute section in the sidebar.
2. Click on the **Keypairs** tab. All available keypairs for that project are listed. The list is empty by default until somebody creates or imports a keypair.
3. Click on the **Create Keypair** button.
4. Specify a name for the key. For example “Mills_Evan_Keypair”
5. Click on the **Create Keypair** button in the dialogue window.
6. The private key is available for download (the web browser may prompt you with download options). Cloudlynx will only store the public key in the project.
7. The keypair now appears on the list of available keypairs under **Access & Security > Keypairs**.

**Note:** The private key has been generated in the browser and there is no copy of the private key in the cloud nor is there a recovery option. The only existing copy is the one you have saved (the .pem file). Treat it like any other private key you may have and make sure not to lose it.

With a Key Generator on a Local Windows Client
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Get a key generator. We use the free open source tool **PuTTYgen** as an example (www.putty.org).
2. Start **PuTTYgen** and click on the **Generate** button and follow the instructions.
3. Optionally, you can change the comment under **Key comment** for easier identification of the key. For extra protection you may also add a phrase under **Key passphrase**.
4. For more security, change the field **Number of bits in a generated key** from 2048 to 4096.
5. Click on the **Save private key** button and it will be saved as a .ppk file.
6. Click on the **Save public key** button to save it in a file for further usage.
7. To import the keypair to the dashboard, copy the text from the field **Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized keys file** to your clipboard.
8. Continue with section Import an Existing Keypair.
