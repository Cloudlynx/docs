Getting Started
===============

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Cloudlynx cloud! This document is designed to help cloud administrators and system operators get started with the cloud environment. It can also act as a reference for daily operations.

The document covers the following topics:

* Compute instance (how to set up, launch and manage instances)
* Storage options (Block and object storage)
* Introduction to APIs and CLI
* Introduction to orchestration (automate the cloud infrastructure)

Before using the Cloudlynx cloud environment, we recommend reading this document to familiarise yourself with the system.

Additional training courses and course material are available on the Cloudlynx website: https://www.cloudlynx.ch

**Note:** This document assumes you have an active Cloudlynx account.

Cloudlynx Dashboard
-------------------

The Cloudlynx dashboard serves as the starting point when accessing the Cloudlynx graphical user interface (GUI). It provides an overview of the current cloud resources being used, as well as listing the cloud services offered by Cloudlynx.

Overview of the Cloudlynx Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Overview** page provides an overview of the cloud resources: applied limits, currently used cloud resources, as well as providing the possibility to query cloud usage from the past.

The Cloudlynx dashboard is split into 3 sections:

* The side bar (left part of the screen)
* The content pane (middle part of the screen)
* The title bar (top part of the screen)

The Side Bar
""""""""""""
The left section of the Cloudlynx dashboard is called the side bar. Here, you will find a list of the cloud services that Cloudlynx provides as well as your current project.

The side bar has the following menu structure:

**Manage Compute**

* Overview:	provides an overview of the current resource usage
* Instances: create, launch and manage instances
* Volumes: create, attach and manage persistent block storage
* Images & Snapshots: create, upload and manage images and snapshots
* Access & Security: configure security of and access to instances 

**Manage Network**

* Network Topology: provides a graphical overview of the network setup
* Networks: create and configure virtual networks, subnets, gateways, IP allocations
* Routers: create, configure and connect routers to virtual networks

**Object Store**

* Containers: create, upload and manage persistent object storage
	
**Orchestration**

* Stacks: execute automatic deployment of a whole cloud setup (including compute, block storage, object storage, network etc.)


**Note:** The Red Hat tab forwards you to the Red Hat Customer Portal. This feature should not be used, as it will be removed in future updates. A Red Hat account or subscription is required for accessing this section.

The Content Pane
""""""""""""""""

This section displays the main content. The shown content will vary depending on the topic selected from the side bar.
On the **Overview** page you are able to query current and past cloud usage, as well as export the results. This can be done by selecting a **From:** and **To:** date and pressing **Submit**. The results are then displayed.

**Note:** The Date format needs to be YYYY-MM-DD.
